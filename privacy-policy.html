  <h1>Privacy Policy for Vault</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 23, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Vault is a privacy-focused application designed to securely store photos and videos
    using encryption on your device. Your privacy is a core principle of the app.
    Vault is designed so that we cannot access, view, or recover your encrypted content.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    Vault does not collect, transmit, or store your personal photos, videos, or vault
    passwords on any developer-controlled servers.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect media content</li>
    <li>We do not collect passwords or recovery keys</li>
    <li>We do not collect personal identifiers such as name, email address, or contacts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Encrypted photos and videos you choose to store</li>
    <li>Encrypted vault metadata required for app functionality</li>
    <li>App settings such as backup preferences</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Encryption & Security</h2>
  <p>
    Vault uses modern cryptographic techniques to encrypt your data locally.
    Encryption keys are derived from passwords you provide and/or a recovery key you generate.
    Vault cannot recover lost passwords or recovery keys.
  </p>

  <h2>Backups & Data Export</h2>
  <p>
    Vault allows you to export encrypted backups of your data to a location you choose,
    such as a device folder or cloud-synced folder. Backups remain encrypted and are never
    received or stored by the developer.
  </p>

  <h2>Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
  <p>
    Vault may offer optional premium features via a subscription processed by
    Google Play Billing. Vault does not collect or store payment information.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Vault does not sell, share, or transmit your personal data to third parties.
    The app contains no advertising SDKs, analytics SDKs collecting personal data,
    or third-party tracking technologies.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You may delete content at any time. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.
    Because data is encrypted and stored locally, it cannot be recovered after deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Vault is not designed for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
    collect personal information from children.
