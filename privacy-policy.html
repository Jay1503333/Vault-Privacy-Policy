# Privacy Policy for Vault

**Last updated:** December 23, 2025

## Overview
Vault is a privacy-focused application designed to securely store photos and videos using encryption on your device. Your privacy is a core principle of the app. Vault is designed so that **we cannot access, view, or recover your encrypted content**.

## Information We Collect
Vault does **not** collect, transmit, or store your personal photos, videos, or vault passwords on any developer-controlled servers.

Specifically:
- We do **not** collect media content
- We do **not** collect passwords or recovery keys
- We do **not** collect personal identifiers such as name, email address, or contacts

## Data Stored on Your Device
Vault stores the following **locally on your device**:
- Encrypted photos and videos you choose to store in the app
- Encrypted vault metadata required for app functionality
- App settings (such as backup preferences)

All sensitive content is encrypted at rest on your device.

## Encryption & Security
Vault uses modern cryptographic techniques to encrypt your data locally.

- Encryption keys are derived from passwords you provide and/or a recovery key you generate
- Vault cannot recover lost passwords or recovery keys
- If you lose your password and recovery key, your data cannot be accessed

You are responsible for safeguarding your password and recovery key.

## Backups & Data Export
Vault allows you to export encrypted backups of your data to a location you choose, such as a folder on your device or a cloud-synced folder.

Important notes:
- Backups are created only when you explicitly initiate them or enable automatic backup
- Backups remain encrypted
- We do not receive or store your backup data

## Subscriptions & Payments
Vault may offer optional premium features via a subscription.

- Payments and subscriptions are processed by **Google Play Billing**
- Vault does not collect or store payment information
- Subscription status is used only to enable or disable premium features

You can manage or cancel your subscription through your Google Play account.

## Data Sharing
Vault does **not** sell, share, or transmit your personal data to third parties.

The app does not include:
- Advertising SDKs
- Analytics SDKs that collect personal data
- Third-party tracking technologies

## Data Deletion
You control your data.

- You may delete content from within the app at any time
- Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data
- Because data is encrypted and stored locally, we cannot recover it after deletion

## Children’s Privacy
Vault is not designed for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this policy.
