# Terms of Use for Vault

**Last updated:** December 23, 2025

## Acceptance of Terms
By downloading, installing, or using Vault (“the App”), you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## Description of Service
Vault is a privacy-focused application that encrypts and stores photos and videos locally on your device. Vault does not provide cloud storage of user content unless explicitly initiated by the user through backup/export features.

## User Responsibilities
You are responsible for:
- Choosing strong passwords
- Safeguarding your vault password and recovery key
- Maintaining backups of your encrypted data

Vault **cannot recover lost passwords or recovery keys**. Loss of these credentials may result in permanent loss of access to your data.

## Data & Security
All content stored in Vault is encrypted locally on your device. Vault does not have access to your content and cannot view or retrieve it.

Use of the App is at your own risk. While reasonable security practices are used, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

## Subscriptions
Vault may offer optional premium features through subscriptions.

- Subscriptions are billed through Google Play
- Pricing, trial periods, and renewal terms are shown at the time of purchase
- You may cancel your subscription through your Google Play account settings
- If a subscription expires, access to premium features will end, but access to your data and export functionality will remain available

## Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Use the App for unlawful purposes
- Attempt to bypass security or encryption features
- Reverse engineer or tamper with the App

## Limitation of Liability
Vault is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for data loss, device issues, or damages resulting from use or inability to use the App.

## Termination
You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it. Uninstalling the App deletes all locally stored data.

## Changes to These Terms
These Terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## Contact
If you have questions about these Terms, you may contact the developer at:
